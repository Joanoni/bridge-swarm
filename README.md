# Bridge — AI Swarm Application

> **v1.3.0** · A standalone Node.js application that orchestrates multi-agent AI swarms powered by Anthropic Claude, with a real-time browser UI.

---

## What is Bridge?

Bridge lets you build and run **autonomous agent swarms**. A special meta-agent called **Swarmito** acts as the orchestrator: it creates agents, assembles teams, spins up project chats, and routes tasks between specialized agents. Agents hand off work to each other automatically via the `handoff_to_agent` tool until the task is complete or control is returned to the user.

---

## Architecture

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| [`server.js`](server.js) | HTTP server (Express) + WebSocket server (ws). Exposes REST API and broadcasts real-time events to all connected browser clients. |
| [`core/engine.js`](core/engine.js) | Thin wrapper around the Anthropic Messages API. Handles the agentic loop (tool calls, `max_tokens` continuation, retries on 429/529), token counting, and cost calculation. |
| [`core/ai-chat.js`](core/ai-chat.js) | Chat session management. Persists history to disk (`history.json` + `raw.json`). Exposes a hook system (`before:message-sent`, `after:message-received`, `before:history-cleared`) used by the swarm layer. |
| [`core/ai-swarm.js`](core/ai-swarm.js) | Swarm routing layer. Hooks into `ai-chat` to inject the `handoff_to_agent` tool and drive the agent handoff loop after each turn. Handles cross-chat handoffs and consecutive self-turn limits. |
| [`core/swarmito.js`](core/swarmito.js) | Swarmito's meta-tools: CRUD for agents, teams, projects, and chats. These tools are only available to the `swarmito` agent. |
| [`core/ai-tools.js`](core/ai-tools.js) | Tool registry. Maps tool names to their implementations and binds agent context (allowed paths, workspace root). |
| [`core/settings.js`](core/settings.js) | Reads/writes `app-settings.json` (API keys, model, spending limit) and `projects.json`. |
| [`public/`](public/) | Single-page application (HTML/CSS/JS). Communicates with the server via REST and WebSocket. |

## Key Concepts

### Swarmito
The built-in orchestrator agent (`agents/swarmito/`). Always present in every chat. Has access to meta-tools for managing the swarm itself (create agents, start chats, etc.) plus the `handoff_to_agent` tool.

### Agents
Each agent lives in a directory (`agents/<id>/` for global agents, `projects/<projectId>/agents/<id>/` for project-scoped agents) containing:
- **`agent.json`** — metadata: `name`, `description`, `tools` (list of tool names), `allowedPaths`, `systemPromptFiles`
- **`system.md`** — the agent's system prompt (or multiple files listed in `systemPromptFiles`)

### Teams
Named groups of agents stored in `teams/<id>/team.json` (global) or `projects/<projectId>/teams/<id>/team.json` (project-scoped). Used by Swarmito to assemble chats.

### Projects
Isolated workspaces under `projects/<uuid>/`. Each project has its own `agents/`, `teams/`, `chats/`, and `src/` directories. Registered in `projects.json`.

### Handoff Tool
Every agent receives the `handoff_to_agent` tool. When an agent calls it with `next_agent: "<agentId>"`, the swarm layer automatically runs the next agent's turn without user intervention. Calling `next_agent: "user"` returns control to the human. An agent may hand off to itself up to 3 consecutive times before the swarm forces a return to the user.

### Tool Permissions
Agents only receive the tools listed in their `agent.json` `tools` array. File-system tools are further restricted to the paths listed in `allowedPaths` (resolved relative to the project's workspace root).

## Available Agent Tools

| Tool name | Description |
|---|---|
| `read_file` | Read a text file from the filesystem |
| `read_binary_file` | Read a binary file (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP) and return it as base64 so the model can visualize it |
| `write_file` | Write (create or overwrite) a file |
| `edit_file` | Apply targeted search/replace edits to an existing file |
| `list_directory` | List files and directories |
| `run_terminal_command` | Execute a shell command (PowerShell on Windows) |
| `web_search` | Search the web via Tavily API |
| `deploy_cloudflare` | Deploy a static site to Cloudflare Pages |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **Anthropic API key** (required) — [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
- **Tavily API key** (optional, required for `web_search`) — [tavily.com](https://tavily.com)

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Running

```bash
# Default port 3000
npm start

# Custom port
node server.js --port 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

---

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `data/app-settings.json` (or `$DATA_DIR/app-settings.json`) and can be edited through the browser UI (Settings panel).

### DATA_DIR

The `DATA_DIR` environment variable controls where all mutable data is stored (agents, chats, teams, projects, settings). Defaults to `./data` inside the repository.

| Environment | Value |
|---|---|
| Local development | *(not set — uses `./data` by default)* |
| Railway with persistent volume | `DATA_DIR=/data` (mount volume at `/data`) |

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | `"anthropic"` | AI provider (currently only Anthropic) |
| `model` | `"claude-sonnet-4-6"` | Model ID |
| `apiKey` | `""` | Anthropic API key |
| `tavilyApiKey` | `""` | Tavily API key (for web search) |
| `spendingLimit` | `0` | Per-checkpoint USD limit (0 = disabled). When the cumulative cost crosses a multiple of this value, the swarm pauses and waits for user approval before continuing. |

### Available Models

| Model ID | Name |
|---|---|
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` | Claude 3.5 Sonnet |
| `claude-3-opus-20240229` | Claude 3 Opus |
| `claude-3-haiku-20240307` | Claude 3 Haiku |

## Swarmito Meta-Tools

These tools are exclusively available to the `swarmito` agent and allow it to manage the swarm at runtime.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_agent` | Create one or more agents (global or project-scoped) |
| `update_agent` | Update agent metadata or system prompt |
| `delete_agent` | Delete one or more agents |
| `copy_agent` | Copy an agent between scopes or projects |
| `create_team` | Create a named group of agents |
| `update_team` | Update a team's members or metadata |
| `delete_team` | Delete a team |
| `copy_team` | Copy a team between scopes |
| `create_project` | Create a new project workspace |
| `start_chat` | Create a new chat and optionally inject a briefing message to kick off the first agent |

---

## Spending Limit

When `spendingLimit` is set to a value greater than `0` (e.g. `1.00`), the swarm pauses every time the cumulative cost for a chat crosses a multiple of that value. The browser UI receives a `SPENDING_LIMIT_REACHED` event and can prompt the user to approve continuation. Sending `RESUME_TURN` resumes the paused turn.
